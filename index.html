                Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client side-extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on HTML form and respond to user events
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database.

            <h2>Introduction to JavaScript and Java</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
                basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                from LiveScript to JavaScript
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile time system of classes built by
                declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                number of data types representing numeric, Boolean and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of a more common
                class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                to declare all variables, classes, adn methods. You do not ahve to be
                concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected. And
                you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters and
                function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello World"
                code:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");
                </code>
            </div>
           
           <p>
               Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic name for values in your application. The names
                of variables, called identifiers, conform certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($);
                subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters
                include "A" trhough "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase)
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as a and u in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
                sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99 and _name
